HugeInt class 
 data
 -int array to store huge number
 -information about digit 

 method
 -operator= for assign
 -operator+ for add algorithm
 -operator- for minus algorithm
 -overloaded constructor for different type of argument
 -cout << operator
 -cin >> operator

Main Spirit

 if the HugeInt is "31415"
 then the int array arrangement is :
 array[0] = 5 
 array[1] = 1
 array[2] = 4
 array[3] = 1
 array[4] = 3
 and the sitnumber is 5.

 For the operator+ alogorithm
 it is simple that I add relative arrayleft[i] with arrayright[i]
 respectively, then check if each of them >= 10.

 For the operator- alogorithm
 I do it just as the add alogorithm, but this time I need to check
 if any result[i] < 0.
